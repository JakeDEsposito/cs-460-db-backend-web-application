<h2 id="original-plan">Original Plan</h2>
<p>Our original design going forward was for us to make a distinct app
for each individual page on the website. This turned out to be rather
problematic for it was redundant because it did not take in to use
“views.”</p>
<h2 id="restructure">Restructure</h2>
<p>We subsequently restructured the format of the Django project by
creating one single and final app which contains “views” for what were
apps in the previous version. This removes the redundancy of having
multiple apps.</p>
<h2 id="login">Login</h2>
<p>For our login page, we designed it to have several types of users in
which the user can pick from. This determines what privilege level the
user will have (given that their <code>ID #</code> permits this level.)
As soon as a correct ID is inputted and the page is redirected to the
respective “view,” the next “view” must know which user logged into the
previous page. This is accomplished by means of “Middleware,” a tool
that allows different pages to pass information on. We specifically
opted to utilize the cookie method, which uses session cookies to
transfer information between “views.”</p>
<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>For this project, we used Python programing language for the backend,
and HTML (and Django templates) for the front end. We used Django
templates to pass Python objects through it in order to have a dynamic
HTML.</p>
<p>Python files:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>__ init __.py: This file was created automatically to allow us to
define any variable at the package level.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>admin.py: This file is has also been created automatically; it is
not used directly in this project. (we created our own admin page from
scratch)<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>apps.py: This file was created to assist users in including any
application configuration for the program. It is used to configure some
of the application’s attributes.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>forms.py: A Django forms file that does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prepares and arranges data for rendering.</li>
<li>Create HTML forms.</li>
<li>Receiving and processing the user’s submitted forms.<br />
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>models.py: This is where the access of our university database
happen. Models access and manage data through Python objects.</p></li>
<li><p>views.py: This python file holds Python views that are classes or
methods that take a web request and provide a web response. (Like HTTP
or HTML)</p></li>
<li><p>urls.py: Here is where we use “urlpatterns” tuples; we define the
mapping between URLs and views by importing module and adding a path
function in urlpatterns[] list.</p></li>
<li><p>manage.py : A command-line utility that allows us to execute our
Django project in various ways.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="database-details">Database details</h3>
<p>MySQL queries were used to manage the database of this project. The
database is approximately of size 4-5 gigabytes.</p>
<h2 id="er-diagram-and-database-schema">ER Diagram and Database
Schema</h2>
<p>In this section, we are presenting university database’s entity
relationship diagram (ERD) along with it’s schema (where in the diagram,
it shows entities are represented)</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>This project has simple security components. There is no
cryptographic concepts of any sort involved. Each user cannot access
other users’ account; the system checks the correctness of inputed
passwords for each user. We also take advantage of MySQL’s built in user
creation queries and user system.</p>
